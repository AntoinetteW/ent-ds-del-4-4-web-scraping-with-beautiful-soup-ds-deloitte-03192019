The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. Amongst other things, this allows programming languages such as javascript to interactively change the page and HTML!  \n",

This structure and the underlying elements can be navigated similar to a family tree which is one of Beautiful Soups main mechanisms for navigation; once you select a specific element within a page you can then navigate to successive elements using methods to retrieve related tags including a tags sibling, parent or descendents.\n",

It allows you to select and navigate the tree-like structure of HTML documents, searching for particular tags, attributes or ids. It also allows you to then further traverse the HTML documents through relations like children or siblings. In other words, with beautiful soup, you could first select a specific div tag and then search through all of its nested tags."
